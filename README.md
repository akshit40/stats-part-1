# Data Science and Statistics Exploration ðŸš€

Proud to share my recent dive into the world of data science and statistics! ðŸ“Š

I've been deeply exploring statistical concepts and their practical applications using Python. Here's a snapshot of the topics I've covered:

### Key Concepts Explored:
1. **Measures of Central Tendency**
   - Mean
   - Median
   - Mode
2. **Five Number Summary & Outlier Detection**
   - Quartiles, Interquartile Range (IQR)
3. **Measures of Dispersion**
   - Variance
   - Standard Deviation
4. **Data Visualization**
   - Boxplots
   - Histograms
   - Probability Density Functions (PDF)
5. **Distribution Analysis**
   - Normal Distribution
   - Log-Normal Distribution
6. **Statistical Plots**
   - Q-Q Plot
7. **Correlation Analysis**
   - Pearson and Spearman Rank Correlation

Leveraging powerful Python libraries like `numpy`, `statistics`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib` to derive insights from data and visualize trends effectively.

This journey is significantly enriching my understanding of data analysis and enhancing my ability to extract meaningful insights from datasets. Looking forward to sharing more as I continue on this exciting path!
